<h2>A Creator & Software Engineer with a knack for UX Design
    ———
    
    Hi! I'm a Computer Science undergrad, currently dedicating time towards improving my knowledge of software engineering principles and best practices while managing web development projects in multiple college societies and an NGO, Vivaann. I'm currently actively looking for full-time opportunities for an SDE-I role around Web Solutions & DevOps.
    
    I am passionate about design – whether it is about the user experience, the interface or the architecture. The impact it has on any given service, business or startup's success is what inspires me to strive for better. I aim to create a more empathetic environment for everyone through clear, conducive design.
    
    I've written a few articles in several places, the most popular one being published in Noteworthy, a Medium publication with a viewership of 45k+ readers. I also organise technical contests and workshops under IEEE , GITAM Student Branch. Reach out for collaboration!
